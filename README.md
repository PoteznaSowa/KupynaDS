# KupynaDS
A command-line tool to digitally sign files using a combination of two Ukrainian cryptographic standards, DSTU 4145-2002 (elliptic curve digital signature) and DSTU 7564:2014 (hash function).
The main idea of the project is to prove that Ukraine needs not use obsolete Soviet cryptographic standards.
